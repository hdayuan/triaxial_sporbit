> j2 = (K-I) / I, tri = (J-I) / I
> otn = omega to n ratio

Version Notes (for simulation runners and plotters)

> If version not specified, it is old (made before versions created)
> Each integer version (not sub-versions) has a corresponding plotting script with the version in the title
> All versions are 3-body simulations (2 planets, 1 star)

v2:

> pretty self-explanatory, all params in directory names
> only differences are what are plotted
> plots omega, theta, phi, psi, eccentricity (replaced with wrapped phi for some directories)
    - phi, psi are unwrapped, but this doesn't seem to work since the data output step is
    much larger than the spin period.

    v2.1:

    > 20 degree mutual inclination between inner and outer orbital planes
    > (K-I) / I = 1e-3 (J2 moment)
    > (J-I) / I = 1e-5 (triaxil moment)
    > Q = 300
    > dt = 0.025 of smallest orbital or spin period
    > plots omega, theta, phi, psi, sk_angle (angle between s hat and k hat)
        - all angles in degrees and remain wrapped
